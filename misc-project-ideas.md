#Frontend & Node.js micro-project ideas that challenge specific skills.

Each project should meet the following criteria:

1. Focus on a small collection of features that will almost certainly be
required in a quality, production web application.
2. Identify two or three skills targeted in the challenge
3. All prerequisites must be attainable through projects listed as a
project in this repo. If it doesn't exist, then make it. 
4. Relevant, free materials & resources should be listed with each
project.

## Draft Project Outline:
(These are not yet ordered or linked together according to the above
standards. )

## JavaScript
- Find a javascript (or jQuery) pluggin that doesn't have tests. Fork
  the repo and write tests with Jasmine. Bonus: Send a pull request to
the source repo once a few tests are complete.
- Find an API at http://www.programmableweb.com/ and use AJAX to display
  content in your own archive. Bonus: Use a templating language like
handle bars to display data

- Use Google Maps API and HTML5 Geo Location to show a client's current
  location. Bonus: Use web sockets to track and update the map in real
time.

  any block level element.

  out. Bonus: Post data to NoSQL database when the user submits the
form.

  can think of. Bonus: Descibe pros and cons of each method in
paragraphs within each implimentation.
- Build a simple, responsive dropdown-menu.
